 * <p>
 * Provides the classes for the {@link org.opt4j.core.optimizer.IndividualCompleter}s.
 * </p> 
 * <p>
 * The task of an {@link org.opt4j.core.optimizer.IndividualCompleter} is to decode and evaluate an
 * {@link org.opt4j.core.Individual}. Finally, the {@link org.opt4j.core.Individual} is in the state {@code
 * evaluated}. In real-world and industrial problems the decoding and evaluation
 * is the most time consuming task. Internally, the {@link org.opt4j.core.optimizer.IndividualCompleter} uses the
 * {@link org.opt4j.core.problem.Decoder} and {@link org.opt4j.core.problem.Evaluator}. In fact, an {@link org.opt4j.core.optimizer.Optimizer} shall 
 * use the {@link org.opt4j.core.optimizer.IndividualCompleter} instead of the {@link org.opt4j.core.problem.Decoder} and
 * {@link org.opt4j.core.problem.Evaluator}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are two predefined completers: The {@link org.opt4j.common.completer.SequentialIndividualCompleter}
 * completes each individual sequentially. The {@link org.opt4j.common.completer.ParallelIndividualCompleter} completes {@code
 * n} individuals in parallel exploiting multicore architectures efficiently.
