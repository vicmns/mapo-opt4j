/**
 * <p>
 * Provides the classes for the optimization problem. 
 * A problem is defined by the following classes: 
 * </p>
 * <dl>
 * <dt>{@link org.opt4j.core.Genotype}</dt>
 * <dd>
 * The {@link org.opt4j.core.Genotype} is the genetic representation of an {@link org.opt4j.core.Individual}.
 * The package {@link org.opt4j.genotype} contains predefined {@link org.opt4j.core.Genotype} classes that allow a modular assembly.
 * Thus, usually you do not have to write your custom {@link org.opt4j.core.Genotype}.
 * </dd>
 * <dd>
 * <dt>{@link org.opt4j.core.Phenotype}</dt>
 * <dd>The {@link org.opt4j.core.Phenotype} represents a solution of the optimization problem.</dd>
 * <dt>{@link org.opt4j.core.problem.Creator}</dt>
 * <dd>The task of the {@link org.opt4j.core.problem.Creator} is the creation of random {@link org.opt4j.core.Genotype}s.</dd>
 * <dt>{@link org.opt4j.core.problem.Decoder}</dt>
 * <dd>The task of the {@link org.opt4j.core.problem.Decoder} is the decoding from a given {@link org.opt4j.core.Genotype} to a corresponding {@link org.opt4j.core.Phenotype}.</dd>
 * <dt>{@link org.opt4j.core.problem.Evaluator}</dt>
 * <dd>The task of the {@link org.opt4j.core.problem.Evaluator} is the evaluation of {@link org.opt4j.core.Phenotype}s to the {@link org.opt4j.core.Objectives}.</dd>
 * </dl>
 * <p>
 * Additional information about the problem should be contained in an user defined class that is injected as needed.
