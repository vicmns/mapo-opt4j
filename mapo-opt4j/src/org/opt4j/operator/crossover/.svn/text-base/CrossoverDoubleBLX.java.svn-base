/**
 * The {@link CrossoverDoubleBLX} is an implementation of the blend crossover
 * operator proposed by Eshelman and Schaffer, 1993.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The BLX crossover is applied element-wise. For two double values {@code y}
 * and {@code x} (assuming {@code y > x} one offspring value is created in the
 * uniform interval {@code [x-(y-x)*alpha;y+(y-x)*alpha]}.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If {@code alpha} is set to {@code 0}, the operator creates a random solution
 * between {@code x} and {@code y}. Values greater zero allow offspring that is
 * apart from the interval between {@code x} and {@code y}. The authors report
 * best performance with {@code alpha = 0.5} which is then called the BLX-0.5
 * operator.
 * </p>
